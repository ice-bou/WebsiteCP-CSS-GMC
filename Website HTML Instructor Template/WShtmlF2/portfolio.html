            <h2>Industries we Serve</h2>

            <dl>
            <strong> <dt>Governments</dt> </strong>
                <dd>Governments are responsible for building stronger communities, and their website is usually the first and most significant source of information that citizens reach out to enrich their lives.
                    One of the main reasons people go on a government website is to complete a task, make a transaction or look for information, so the design must be built with customer journeys in mind and also adapt his experience depending on the device. If someone is looking for court information from a mobile device, for example, they are probably searching for details like phone number or address - ensuring that this kind of information is prominently displayed is part of the best practices.
                </dd>
<br>
                <strong> <dt>Finance</dt> </strong>
                <dd>Fintech is an industry like no other. Top-level security is crucial when large sums of money are processed and sensitive data is involved. Having a seamless performance is vital, especially in stock trading software solutions. 
                    A user-centered approach and high usability are also a priority when the business aims to serve thousands of users. Finance, banking, and insurance are all highly competitive industries. Hence, at Imaginary Cloud, we take the time to validate your concept and advise you on the finest technological solutions for your specific situation. We also provide unique AI and Data Science-based solutions to ensure that your product maximizes its potential.

<br>
                <strong> <dt>Security</dt> </strong>
                <dd>For the past several years, security has dominated headlines and significantly impacted the privacy and confidentiality of millions of users. Security plays a critical role in today's society, where safe and trustworthy software is necessary to protect our personal information and important business data.
                    But it s important to remember that no web or app is bulletproof to attacks. Hackers will eventually discover a way past any code, security protocols, firewalls, and other protections and break into your software.

<br>
                <strong> <dt>Logistic</dt> </strong>
                <dd>Almost any business has to deal with logistics in one form or another. Good logistics ensure that operations run smoothly and that overhead costs are minimized. We understand how competitive the logistics industry can be and know what it takes to bring your web app a world-class image for your business.
                    We know how to push the crucial elements of your logistics companies, such as tracking your shipments, generating sales leads, and, most importantly, helping your clients have the best user experience possible!

               <strong> <dt>Technology </strong>
                <dd> Alongside software, technology is perhaps the world's fastest-changing industry. Nowadays, the majority of tech companies strive for a website that continuously generates leads. Being aware of such necessity in advance will enable you to focus on planning an app or website that will support your sales and marketing goals - whether that’s driving more traffic to your website or blog, or getting more people to register for a demo of your software.
                </dd>
<br>
                <strong> <dt>Manufacturing</dt> </strong>
                <dd>Before the internet became a part of our daily lives, industrial and manufacturing enterprises focused their marketing efforts mostly on traditional sales techniques such as trade exhibitions, conferences, and ads in industry magazines. Websites were seen by manufacturers as just proof that the company existed.
                    Fortunately, most manufacturing companies now recognize the importance of their online presence as it works as a lead-generating tool. Research shows that even when manufacturers are not selling products directly online, their website is usually the most effective point of conversion as it plays a vital role in shaping consumer perspectives about the brand, quality, and customer service.
